The extend projets are great and very popular, they need to have each
one a different mailing list.

And mailman has a really useless web interface.

I love the farwest technical choices. But Riak seems to only be the
"prototype' database, and PostgreSQL the real target.

FMO, this is a huge fail. Riak is by far superior to PostgreSQL. I
want Riak, who really wants PostgresSQL ??

That would be true if there was actual activity on the mailing lists.

It's a bit like comparing sports cars to superbikes.  Riak has some very powerful features; Pipes, true clustering, fault tolerance, Riak CS etc.  Plus, it's built on Erlang :-)  PostgreSQL has SQL queries, real tables (rather than simple corruptible namespacing), complex query capabilities, real data types etc.  Each has their place.

I said no activity, I didn't say no members. Please keep your complaints 
about the tool down, it's got nothing to do with it, and you just end up 
spamming people here.

All development happens on IRC, so this leaves the mailing lists only 
useful for questions, which should be rarer over time considering the 
docs keep improving and the archives provide great answers for the rest. 
It's all good.

Riak is written in Erlang. See your own argumentations on why Erlang
is the best langage to program high load/fault-tolerent web software.

Riak is written in Erlang, as all the 99 other soft -> good
integration of the whole.

Riak is a NoSQL Dynamo database with Availability and Partition
tolerance, and this is what I want for my web applications. PostgreSQL
is a SQL Availability and Consistency old school database.

Riak is just what want a developer who use erlang to have a scaling platform.

Postgres has been made to scale well in GIS applications.  Apple is using Postgres for their current Maps geo point storage.

I don't agree. More you have users, more you should have questions on
the mailing list, even if the documentation is improving.

I'm on the mailing lists of **a lot** of free software with great
documentations, and they are very active.

Where is the history of the choices/debates made on IRC ?

NoSQL is a trend, but is often not the best choice for data storage.  The reason it has had a strong revival recently (no, NoSQL is not a new thing) is because it is simpler for non-SQL developers to jump into and requires less thought on structuring your data.  However, there are many scenarios where NoSQL is a bad choice.  For example, I would certainly hope my bank doesn't log my transactions using NoSQL!

Let me clarify a few misconceptions here. (Mostly to show the choice 
isn't random, don't take it wrong.)

Riak and Riak CS are two different things. You most likely don't want to 
run them together, especially considering the hardware requirements will 
differ.

Riak core, pipes, etc. are not really useful if you only use Riak as a 
data store. It's cool that your DB has a great distributed processing 
framework but pretty useless when you just want to retrieve some data 
and format it in a web page.

Riak has clustering, yes. PostgreSQL has clustering too.

Riak has data-center aware clustering also if you get Riak Enterprise. 
But it costs a lot (per node!). You can do the same with PostgreSQL at a 
fraction of the price.

Riak is built on Erlang, sure. But why should I care? I only want it to 
handle my data. I don't want to look at the code. PostgreSQL is a much 
proven piece of software.

You're right, but is Farwest designed to develop banf software ? I
don't think so.

See the post I just sent. I have no reason to care about the language 
here. It's not going to run in the same node. I'm not going to look at 
it. And PostgreSQL is a much proven software, much more than Riak who's 
had issues with the Erlang schedulers and more and is still young.

The need for partitioning comes a *lot* later for SQL databases. They 
can deal with big amounts of data just fine. And Farwest is made for 
small to medium applications, therefore the issue will likely never come 
up until Farwest itself becomes the issue.

> Riak is just what want a developer who use erlang to have a scaling platform.

This is the first time I hear complaints about choosing PostgreSQL.

Because CGI, PHP, Perl, ... aren't. But you can put Apache in front of 
Farwest just fine if you need to.

Hey, don't direct that at me :-S  I was agreeing with you :-D

The only point I would differ with (and I may be wrong, as it was about 12 months ago that I researched this) is that I do feel, for clustering, that Riak does it better.  I'd much rather the dynamo model than a master-to-many slaves model.

No such thing. No need for it either, the choices tend to change a few 
times until things stabilize.

Yes you're right, all clustering are far to be equal. Dynamo is really
great, and master-to-master is just an archaic way to do things you
don't really know to do.

I know, hence the "don't take it wrong".

You have a few different projects enabling multi-master replication for 
PostgreSQL. It's not an issue.

This is a really wrong way. Free software needs public transparency.

Public transparency like a public IRC channel anyone can join and log?

Me for one. Rarely have a use case that fits Riak but daily have use
cases that fit a RDBMS, and Postgres is the best of those in my opinion.

Florent, I suggest you actually contribute something before telling
the project maintainer how to run things and flaming people who *have*
contributed.

Jeremy, I tried to test farwest very early :
https://github.com/extend/farwest/pull/4

My "bad idee" of a server-sent events handler is now part of bullet :
https://github.com/extend/bullet/issues/16

Jeremy, maybe I haven't contribute something on this project because :
- I spend a lot of time working as a lawyer
- I spend a lot of time working on other free software
- I'm not yet a great Erlang programmer

AND

- There's no visibility on what is really doing, and who is doing it,
and why, and how it's decided. So I can't lose more time on that
because I can't know what is happened and what will happen.

I flame nobody. I give the 2 cents of help I can give. This is a
contribution. You can think it's useless, but I don't think so.

In free software, if you want a great success, you should be more open
that just have a free software licence.
You should do the life easier for the people interested in this
project and who want to help. You can think it's not a problem, but I
think it is. Is that a flame ?

Or, you know, you could just open a ticket or ask like anyone else, 
preferrably the former. Chances are whatever you're thinking of doing 
has no chance of being merged at all, or could be interesting but only 
if certain implementation details are respected, or needs to involve 
other people.

Even if we did put more info on who does what, this still wouldn't 
remove the necessity for you to ask if you want to avoid losing your time.

I for one, prefer Postgres. Not everything can be mapped to kv and that's
the only thing Riak is good for. It's not fit for a general purpose
database.
To me, NoSQL is about specialization. Each db excels at one type of
operation (and then there's mongo, but that's for another time), while
RDBMSs offer general purpose solutions. I begin my projects with an RDBMS
(usually Postgres) and when a particular piece of data is the bottleneck, I
move it to the appropriate NoSQL db.

It's finally here!

It's still a mess in the two other repositories so I recommend waiting 
before digging in too much. This is just a direct port of the prototype 
to a more workable build suite and repository structure.

  *  https://github.com/extend/farwest_core/
  *  https://github.com/extend/farwest_ui/

A lot of work will be done on farwest_core next, while at the same time 
the frontend dude takes care of making the UI good.

Enjoy!

Subject: [99s-extend] [ANN] erlang.mk build tool
Message-ID: <520CE37E.4090909@ninenines.eu>

Hello friendly people,

I would like to make an official announcement of erlang.mk now that all 
the features I wanted are in.

erlang.mk is a rebar replacement. It was initially created for allowing 
a faster development process than rebar and for better compatibility 
with Linux build tools. It should work on Linux and OSX with GNU Make 
installed.

Projects using erlang.mk are still compatible with rebar. Dependencies 
fetched by rebar are stored in the same deps/ directory, and projects 
using erlang.mk can still be used as rebar dependencies, with or without 
a rebar.config file.

erlang.mk also features a simple package index. Try `make pkg-list` to 
list all packages currently available. All the packages listed are 
compatible with erlang.mk with no tweaking required.

Makefiles written with erlang.mk are *VERY* simple, here are two examples:

  *  https://github.com/extend/farwest/blob/master/Makefile
  *  https://github.com/extend/cowboy/blob/master/Makefile

I wrote about erlang.mk and relx recently on the Nine Nines blog. 
erlang.mk is the perfect companion to relx.

  *  http://ninenines.eu/articles/erlang.mk-and-relx

Here are examples of projects that are using and compatible with erlang.mk:

  *  https://github.com/jlouis/etorrent
  *  https://github.com/extend/cowboy
  *  https://github.com/extend/farwest

You can find erlang.mk at the following URL:

  *  https://github.com/extend/erlang.mk

Contributions to the package index are of course welcome! The only 
requirement is that the package is to be compatible with erlang.mk 
itself. Just send a PR to the erlang.mk project updating the 
packages.v1.txt!

Enjoy!

Please include an ability to cleanly override any target so make does
not emit warnings about overwritten target. There are a few ways to do
it, but I find this the easiest: prefix every target in erlang.mk with
a variable:

$(.erlang-mk-all)all:
  <your stuff>

That way, if $(.erlang-mk-all) is defined (from my application
Makefile before including erlang.mk), your 'all' target will be the
one that does not cause me warnings.

Yes I was thinking about this, but so far nobody needed it. If you do, 
though, patches welcome!

wget is only used for fetching the package index file. I'm sure if it 
doesn't work somewhere it'll be patched eventually.

No idea. Patches are welcome for compatibility with different OS/build 
tools (as long as it's not "rewrite the whole file" of course, then 
you're better off just using gmake).

I have been using erlang.mk for a while now, and recently I converted
etorrent to use it as a test of the viability in larger projects. Typical
gotchas:

* Projects has no Makefile. erlang.mk needs one. So add one!
* No `modules` section in the .app file. erlang.mk needs one to replace it.
Not adding this makes relx behave badly.
* If you use relx, it is more strict in what it accepts.
* Relx can't yet overlay sys.config :/

Apart from that, erlang.mk is a bliss to work with. In one project I am
working with:

Core i5 2.4Ghz approx 2010 Macbook Pro, encrypted disk (this hurts
performance like mad):

Cold build:

Rebar: 40 secs
elrang.mk: 42 secs

Build where each file is compiled in advance:

Rebar: 20 secs
erlang.mk: 0.4 secs

For my development cycle, this is important enough to spend time rewriting
projects to use erlang.mk. Also note that rebar.config and erlang.mk can
co-exist, so you don't need to abandon rebar for erlang.mk, which is
important.

The big problem with erlang.mk is requiring to have gmake and more
importantly wget installed imo.

Which makes it quite annoying to distribute on systems that have none of
them. It would be interrestin to have the support for curl for example.
Also what are the makefile extensions that you really need to require gmake?

I believe
curl -L $(PKG_FILE_URL) >$(PKG_FILE)
is kinda drop-in replacement for
wget -O $(PKG_FILE) $(PKG_FILE_URL)
used in erlang.mk.

Should be tested

Looks good - I like simple!  Quick question, does it support multiple applications, for example a project laid out as:  

/proj
/deps
/stuff

/apps
/app1
/app2

Most of our stuff is in that form, with shared dependencies between the various apps.  Rebar is quite happy with that format, but I can't see how to persuade erlang.mk to handle that.

Cheers,

Steve

Why not use Erlang for downloading? Surely if erlang.mk is a tool for 
Erlang then it will be very likely installed. For example this target 
downloads Rebar:

# Erlang Rebar downloading, see:
# 
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/erlang-programming/U0JJ3SeUv5Y
rb_rebar_url=http://cloud.github.com/downloads/basho/rebar/rebar
./rebar:
$(ERL) -noshell -s inets -s ssl \
-eval 'httpc:request(get, {"$(rb_rebar_url)", []}, [], [{stream, 
"./rebar"}])' \
-s init stop
chmod +x ./rebar
REBAR=$(shell (type rebar 2>/dev/null || echo ./rebar) | tail -1 | awk 
'{ print $$NF }')


It could be used to download anything, not just REBAR.

Well I'm sure if you create a base Makefile (without erlang.mk) that 
exports DEPS_DIR and then call $(MAKE) on all folders in /apps (which 
would themselves contain Makefiles that use erlang.mk), it would work 
just fine. You can still keep only one erlang.mk in your repos and use 
include ../../erlang.mk instead for example.

But know that this folder structure is a rebar thing and not standard 
(just like /deps you'll say, but that one is insanely useful regardless 
of the project structure otherwise).

Starting Erlang takes too long. That's a big reason why erlang.mk was 
created. :)

I recall NetBSD being able to download things with a shell script only 
(as it comes with nothing installed), this would be a more interesting 
solution especially since we can bundle it in the erlang.mk file too.

But it "is only used for fetching the package index file"... :) If the 
target is up to date there is no starting of Erlang. But on the other 
hand it could be used conditionally, e.g. use wget on systems on which 
it is installed and Erlang otherwise. It's just down to creating a 
properly structured target, isn't?

I know, and if it makes it work where it currently doesn't I'd merge it. 
But ultimately we want to avoid starting Erlang unless strictly necessary.

Will it support protobuf(https://github.com/basho/erlang_protobuffs),
I cannot compile *.proto file from src/ with erlang.mk.

That's a good question. I probably would merge such a patch right now, 
but if it ends up being too many different compilers we'll probably need 
a better solution (something like having you include both erlang.mk and 
protobuffs.mk to enable it?).

I don't use protobuffs myself so don't count on me though.

I'd prefer it if there were more generalized hooks for files of
different names rather than hardcoding usage of a particular library.
In the case of protobuffers, some people use piqi, others use basho's
library, and still others use their own library.

Message-ID: <CAD_32VWVNb_-vHChdC2S4CcFeJ29v5n3w6B0LNS5=RqWQxKaAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to ranch. In my application, I need to send some message to
all connections. So I'd like to know can I get all connections from
ranch, so I could use Transport:send to send them, or I must manage
all the created connections by myself? Or is there any other better
way?

Thanks.

Bin Wang

The best way to do that is on your end, using gproc properties. When the 
connection is accepted, register the process with the property and use 
the property to send messages to all processes. You don't need to 
unregister when the connection ends, gproc does that automatically.

The hackish way to do that would be to call supervisor:which_children on 
the ranch_conns_sup supervisor of your listener, but that will slow down 
the accepting of new connections, so don't do this if you need high 
accept rates.

This is exactly the sort of thing gen_event is for. I would make each
server process register a handler at startup using
gen_event:add_sup_handler() and then have the handle_event callback simply
relay the event to the server processes. Yes, gproc can do this, but why
incur its extra features and overhead?
