Subject: [99s-extend] Can't start syslog when built with erlang.mk
Message-ID: <CA+_xk0nrg_gCKLDBPFNoPBmECNVdZs_MbXotEn1F-xWy9Y__HA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings...

I'm finding that I can't start syslog when it is built as a dependency of
my erlang.mk project.  For example:

$ erl -pa _rel/${MY_PROJECT}/lib/*/ebin
Erlang/OTP 18 [erts-7.0] [source] [64-bit] [async-threads:10] [hipe]
[kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V7.0  (abort with ^G)
1> syslog:start().
{error,"could not load driver syslog_drv: \"cannot open shared object file:
No such file or directory\""}


The root of the problem seems to be that erlang.mk compiled syslog_drv.c as
"syslog.so" and syslog expects to load "syslog_drv.so".  I have confirmed
that renaming the file solves the problem.

What do I do with that?

Open a ticket and this will be fixed, probably just need to handle a 
case we don't do yet. :-)
