Small update to Ranch: https://github.com/extend/ranch

  *  Allow fail_if_no_peer_cert option in ranch_ssl
  *  Allow next_protocols_advertised option in ranch_ssl

Second one is mostly just for SPDY.

Enjoy!

Just tagged a new version: https://github.com/extend/cowboy

Focus has been mostly the body reading API, which should be much faster 
and also safer to use now.

Enjoy!

  Cowboy aims to use binaries, not strings, and unless there's a change in the head branch I don't have, the returned tuple has only two values, the value and the request. So it should look like something like -

  {Value, Req2} = cowboy_req:header(<<"user-agent">>, Req)

Hello tell me how I can get for example http header "user-agent"?
I do so:

handle(Req, State) ->

{ok, FwdIP, Req5} = cowboy_req:header("user-agent, Req)

but in this place I get the error

Hi, guys,
my problem is, if the client is closed or network broken, how to
handle these situation with cowboy.

Get it. When something happed with client or network, socket will
broke, and Transport:send/2 will return {error, closed}, etc.

So, just make sure each Transport:send(...) is correct, like this:
ok = Transport:send(Socket, Data),

the rest will be handle by cowboy.

Message-ID: <CAJ0zLRP41RayBRrthv1e18ZW_kDYa8q7s0VOub-MzHrT1unmfA@mail.gmail.com>

Does anybody have an example of Cowboy app that includes a login page,
secure area and user registration form? It's easy to put this together
using ChicagoBoss framework, but I was wondering if somebody has done
this just using pure Cowboy.

Thank you,
