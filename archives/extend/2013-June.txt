Subject: [99s-extend] Cowboy handler and custom gen_server link
Message-ID: <CAM=nw2VPVVFjVW22fwzA-poQJbM4Yakh9-cZ8L5igHMVi-BSoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to implement REST handler which communicates to custom
gen_servers.

Get gen_server from supervisor and link to current handler process:

rest_init(Req, _Opts) ->
...
  process_flag(trap_exit, true),
  {ok, Pid} = pbshare_logic_sup:start_registration(),
  link(Pid),
...

make_get(Req, State) ->
....
make error here !!!
....


And gen_server code:
start_link() ->
  gen_server:start_link(?MODULE, [], []).

init(Args) ->
  process_flag(trap_exit, true),
  {ok, []}.

handle_info({'EXIT', FromPid, Reason}, State) ->
  lager:info("Exit Logic from ~p  Reason: ~p~n", [FromPid, Reason]),
  {noreply, State};

So I expect to receive EXIT signal from REST handler to my gen_server when
error occurs in cowboy.
But I don't receive it. Am I doing something wrong?

Subject: [99s-extend] [ANN] Cowboy 0.8.6 and Ranch 0.8.4 (R16B01 compatible)
Message-ID: <51C30E86.8050305@ninenines.eu>

Hello,

Just a heads up, a new version of Cowboy and Ranch has been pushed that 
fixes compilation and documentation for R16B01: you now need the asn1 
application to be started when using SSL. They will be started 
automatically if they weren't before, but you will need them in your 
release (done automatically with relx).

Other interesting changes for Cowboy include:

  *  Support for compression of Websocket frames (thanks Ali Sabil)

  *  Initial support for SPDY

Both are experimental features and undocumented at this point, but 
feedback is more than welcome. See the changelog for more information.

  *  https://github.com/extend/cowboy
  *  https://github.com/extend/ranch

Enjoy!
