<PRE>  Will do. I actually like the 303 due to a bug in Firefox with examining
headers, but 201 seems like the canonical approach.
  
  CORS is actually pretty easy to open up fully, and the more restrictive
you want to be the harder it gets. We're not using credentials, and we
haven't tightened the domain to just those we expect, either, but it
basically amounts to adding the following to options/2 for the pre-flight -

  * Access-Control-Allow-Origin (with the origins we want to allow; * for
anything), 
  * Access-Control-Allow-Headers (which we're setting to the same as the
client requests for convenience's sake)
  *Access-Control-Expose-Headers (for any headers beyond content-type that
the client wants access to; we have Location for the 201 mentioned above.


And the following to any request being passed back, as seems reasonable -

  * Access-Control-Allow-Origin as in options
  * Access-Control-Expose-Headers as in options


 I'm appending them in resource_exists/2 because I know that will be hit
by everything. If your logic is more complex (you want to allow PUTs from
site1, but deletes from site2, etc), you'll need to break that apart a bit
and conditionally check origin. We're relying on a firewall to protect
against direct calls from external servers, and we'll be tightening the
allowed domains and looking into validating the session with a token to
prevent CSRFs (as CORS means any existing CSRF vuln becomes a bit more
severe). 


I suspect there's some redundancy there; we have a future story for
tightening things up, but in terms of just opening it up and getting
things working, that&#185;s all that I had to do.
