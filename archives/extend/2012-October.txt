Subject: [99s-extend] cowboy_http_handler type spec
Message-ID: <CAJ0zLROkOMkqD7Mcv-JtSb7tyTWsra4NW-O-KGzBsLmOE3=gig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone, newb questions here:

Is the reason why the type specification for the init callback lists
various "{loop,..." tuples, because a single module can implement
cowboy_loop_handler and cowboy_http_handler?
And this way, a dializier warning will not be triggered?
https://github.com/extend/cowboy/blob/master/src/cowboy_http_handler.erl#L39

Because looking at the handler code,
https://github.com/extend/cowboy/blob/master/src/cowboy_protocol.erl#L473 if
the {loop, * is returned from init, then the handle(Req, State) will not be
processed.

Also, is it safe to say that Handler:init is like "before" in lot's of web
frameworks. I can place validation\authentication logic there.

Sincerely,

-rambocoder

Yes that's exactly why. Not the best solution but good enough.

You have this one if you just want loops:

https://github.com/extend/cowboy/blob/master/src/cowboy_loop_handler.erl

Having an identical init in both allows us to use the 2 handlers without 
Dialyzer complaining.

Definitely, prepare what you need in init, do what you need to do in 
handle and clean up in terminate if needed.
