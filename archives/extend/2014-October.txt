Subject: [99s-extend] Prevent resource creation on POST
Message-ID: <20141005025658.GA12424@newton.local>

Hello,

I was recently tinkering with cowboy_rest and found that there is no way prevent resource creation in a POST request when it already exists. Either that, or I'm probably not doing something right or don't know enough...

Here's what I have running:
A user tries to signup with a post request. To be successful, the username has to be unique. The resource_exists/2 method responds with proper true and false values by looking at the request body.

Here's what I want done:
Iff the resource_exists callback returns true, I don't want the AcceptResource callback to run at all. Instead, I want to send a 4XX status and halt. Is there a canonical way of doing this?

Cheers,

AH

If resource_exists = true, then POST doesn't create but update the 
resource at the given URI. If what you are doing is something like 
write-once resources then you will have to reject these cases manually 
by returning halt at some point.

Subject: [99s-extend] PUT on new resource and status 201
Message-ID: <CAE7UswcWMj-voOs4eSbYxNyfkHZ8anCeUr6JyBGU+RhODk5Nig@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

just subscribed yesterday and now that's already my first question.

I'm referring to
http://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/1.0/guide/rest_flowcharts/. Given you
have a PUT on a new resource the diagram suggests that the response's
status code depends on whether you've set a location and/or body. But when
looking at the code (v1.0.0) then cowboy_rest:maybe_created/2 would always
return a 201. No matter what. I think the code is right, but the diagram
needs to be fixed.

But then I'm not totally sure how to interpret
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.2.2 which states

   The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s)
   returned in the entity of the response, with the most specific URI
   for the resource given by a Location header field.


Because currently it is totally possible to not have a location header
set (just as no body) for the response. In my opinion the current code
behaves good enough and it's up to the service to ensure the
requirements as stated by the RFC. Should cowboy enforce a header
field? Should it try to figure that out on its own?


Regards,


Stefan

This is correct, I have experience this behaviour on Cowboy 1.0.0 and 2.0.0-pre.1.

Could you be more specific?
I?m afraid it is not how it works for me.

I think how Cowboy does is best at the moment.
I like to have the freedom to specify myself the Location, especially when PUT-ting new resources.


A bit off topic, I think this article is interesting regarding RFC-2616.

	https://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/06/07/rfc2616_is_dead

Given that, you might want to have a look at RFC-7231, section 3.1.4.2:

	http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.4.2.

Yes it looks like you are on to something there. Please open a ticket 
and I will look later on. There's another change near that area that 
needs to be made with POST, I will look at both at the same time.

In my opinion the current code behaves good enough and it's up to the service to ensure the requirements as stated by the RFC. Should cowboy enforce a header field?

201 does not require a location header if the resource is created at the 
path indicated by the request. Specifying a different URI is a rare 
occurrence with PUT, it should only occur if you create the resource on 
a different domain name (think a CDN pushing the file to a subdomain).

And as Camille stated, forget RFC 2616, the various RFCs from httpbis is 
where it's at now.

Hello,

Has anyone had trouble getting IE9 connecting to Cowboy over HTTPS?

We're using Cowboy embedded in MongooseIM, and IE9 is giving us fits.


Thanks,




David
