Subject: [99s-extend] Cowboy, relx, and dev mode, oh my!
Message-ID: <CAABECY2WtE92TwP0p_9pQFihvfqtf53oARPTxQnbz9Xvw-GjOw@mail.gmail.com>

I was fiddling with some js, and got tired of restarting the server. I was
under the
impression that using dev_mode with relx was the solution to this problem,
but
I can't seem to get it to work. I have an example here:

https://github.com/grahamrhay/cowboy_devmode

If I look in _rel, the lib folder for my app is a symlink, as expected. Yet
when I change
the web page, the rendered page is unchanged. I've tried a hard reload, and
clearing
the cache.

And, in case that wasn't annoying enough, even restarting the server isn't
enough!
Nor is running make again. In fact, the only way I've found of getting it
to update,
is to turn off dev mode, and build the release.

Am I missing something really obvious? As far as I can tell from perusing
the code,
the cowboy static handler just serves the file directly from the file
system.

(P.S. I am using vagrant, but I would expect that to cause errors rather
than this, if
the symlink wasn't working.)

Running the release, stopping it, editing the file, running the release 
again works here. I suspect something related to Vagrant.

Also I suggest 'make run' rather than your start.sh.

Wait, I'm dumb. These steps also work:

Running the release, opening the website and seeing ohai, editing the 
file with some extra text, reloading, seeing the extra text.

Yeah, that's how I expected it to work. I'll see if I can identify how
vagrant is causing me problems.

Didn't know about "make run", thanks :)

Opened 4 years ago :( Maybe I should give VMware some money.

It's not the first time I see this bug. Can you open a ticket on the 
Cowboy project so it gets documented in some kind of "gotchas" section?
