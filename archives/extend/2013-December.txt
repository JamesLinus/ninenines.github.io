Hi,

I am using cowboy for our financial webservice platform.  We use token
based authentication, but I want to give certain ip adresses full access
without authentication.  I tried :

{{IP, Port}, Req2} = cowboy_req:peer(Req).

but IP is always {127,0,0,1} - even on production (where request
are comming from different networks)

So my question is basically, Is there any way for me to see
frow which IP adresses the request is comming ?

Hi,

It sounds like you have a proxy of some kind on the same machine. The 
proxy would likely set a header with the real IP in it, or at least have 
an option for it.

Hey Dagur,

Look through all headers, normally a proxy will set something like X-Forwarded-For or similar.

Subject: [99s-extend] erlang.mk:109 sed \s is not portable
Message-ID: <CA+Z8kA7UwsDP2KeLSBEqQ2GBZZwCTgDoD8SOJ8RZ47-StQE6XQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have recently started using erlang.mk on MacOS X and OpenBSD, and have
discovered that the sed escape \s on line 109 for inserting the module list
in *.app does not work as intended on these OSs, because they do not use
GNU sed. (\s just means the letter 's', not whitespace as in perl.) I
expect all other BSD-based OSs to have the same issue.

Please consider using [[:space:]] instead. This works on both MacOS X and
OpenBSD, as well as on Linux.

This has been fixed for a few weeks now. Please check the bug tracker 
(or commit log) next time, as this is where bugs get reported/fixed.

Thanks.

Hello,

*** GOAL: 

Modify rest_pastebin in Cowboy examples.

*** PROCEDULE 1: 

- Pulled Cowboy, including examples into local workstation
- Copied rest_pastebin to a separate directory
- Execute make
      Make compiles just fine

*** PROCEDUE 2 -- resulting in error

- delete the entire rest_pastebin application and recopy from the Cowboy pull
- change all module names and references from rest_pastebin to tagr. Thus rest_pastebin_sup.erl becomes tagr_sup.erl
- Execute make
      Make returns:

...
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/lloyd/Erl/CB/tagr/deps/cowboy'
 ERLC   toppage_handler.erl tagr_sup.erl tagr_app.erl
 ERLC   toppage_handler.erl tagr_sup.erl tagr_app.erl
 APP    tagr .app.src
cat: src/tagr: No such file or directory
cat: .app.src: No such file or directory
sed: can't read .app: No such file or directory
make: *** [app] Error 2

Note that the filename tagr.app.src has somehow been modified to tagr .app.src

But here's the directory listing: 

-rw-rw-r-- 1 lloyd lloyd  436 Dec 26 18:21 tagr_app.erl
-rw-rw-r-- 1 lloyd lloyd  299 Dec 26 18:22 tagr.app.src
-rw-rw-r-- 1 lloyd lloyd  382 Dec 26 18:22 tagr_sup.erl
-rw-rw-r-- 1 lloyd lloyd 3568 Dec 26 18:23 toppage_handler.erl

I can load tagr.app.src in Vim. Using find I've searched for tagr and .app.src with negative results.

Further mystery. I substituted Rebar for relx. Tagr now compiles just fine.

*** Discussion

I stumbled on this problem after making fairly extensive modifications to rest_pastebin. Through much of the process it compiled just fine until it didn't. And from then on I could not get it to compile. I tried everything I could think of: careful source code review (at least 10 passes), searching for tagr .app.src, trying different names (e.g. tagger), rebooting my computer, etc., etc.

Eventually I reduced the problem to the absolute minimum: Change the string rest_pastebin to tagr everywhere relevant. 

It's possible I'm missing something somewhere. But where should I look? Otherwise, is it possible that there is a subtle bug in relx?


Many thanks,

Lloyd
