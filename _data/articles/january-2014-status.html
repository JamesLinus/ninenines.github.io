<p>I will now be regularly writing posts about project status, plans
and hopes for the future.</p>

<p>Before that though, there's one important news to share.</p>

<p>Until a year ago all development was financed through consulting
and development services. This worked alright but too much time was
spent doing things that didn't benefit the open source projects.
And that didn't make me happy at all. Because I like being happy
I stopped that for the most part and spent the year figuring things
out, experimenting and discussing with people about it.</p>

<p>What makes me happy is answering these "what if" questions.
Ranch and Cowboy are a direct product of that, as they originate
from the "what if we could have a server running different protocols
on different ports but all part of the same application?"; erlang.mk
is a bit different: "this works great for me, what if it could
become the standard solution for building Erlang applications?".</p>

<p>When I successfully answer the question, this becomes a project
that may end up largely benefiting the Erlang community. I love
Erlang and I love enabling people to build awesome products based
on my projects. It's a lot more rewarding than activities like
consulting where you only help one company at a time. And it's
also a much better use of my time as this has a bigger impact on
the community.</p>

<p>The hard part is to figure out how to be able to spend 100%
of the time on projects that you basically give away for free,
and still be able to afford living.</p>

<p>The immediate solution was getting work sponsored by the
<a href="http://www.leofs.org/">LeoFS project</a>. LeoFS is a great
distributed file storage that I can only recommend to anyone who
needs to store files or large pieces of data. The sponsorship
works pretty great, and spurred development of the SPDY code in
Cowboy amongst other things, plus a couple upcoming projects
done more recently and getting a final touch before release.</p>

<p>It turns out sponsoring works great. So I'm thinking of
expanding on it and hopefully get enough sponsoring for fulltime
open source development. So I figured out a few things that
can give incentive to companies willing to sponsor.</p>

<p>Sponsors can <em>request that a particular version of Cowboy
be maintained indefinitely</em> (as long as they're sponsoring).
This means fixes will be backported. This doesn't include
features although I can take requests depending on feasability.</p>

<p>Sponsors can <em>have a direct, private line of communication</em>,
useful when they need help debugging or optimizing their product.</p>

<p>Sponsors can <em>get their name associated with one of the
project</em> and get a good standing in the community thanks
to this. They would be featured in the README of the project
which is viewed by hundreds of developers daily.</p>

<p>Sponsors can <em>be listed on this website</em>. I will modify
the front page when we get a few more sponsors, they will be
featured below the carousel of projects.</p>

<p>Please <a href="mailto:contact@ninenines.eu">contact us</a> if
you are interested in sponsoring, and say how much you are willing
to sponsor. The goal here is only to have enough money to make a
living and attend a few conferences. There's an upper limit in the
amount needed per year, so the more sponsors there are the cheaper
it becomes to everyone.</p>

<p>The upper limit stems from the new legal entity that will replace
the current Nine Nines. This is mostly to lower the legal costs and
simplify the administrative stuff and allow me to dedicate all my
time on what's important. From your point of view it's business as
usual.</p>

<p>Now on to project statuses and future works.</p>

<h2>Cowboy</h2>

<p>Cowboy is getting ready for a 1.0 release. Once multipart support
is in, all that's left is finishing the guide, improving tests and
finishing moving code to the cowlib project. I hope everything will
be ready around the time R17B is released.</p>

<p>I already dream of some API breaking changes after 1.0, which
would essentially become 2.0 when they're done. An extensive survey
will be setup after the 1.0 release to get more information on what
people like and don't like about the API.</p>

<p>And of course, when clients start implementing HTTP/2.0 then we
will too.</p>

<h2>Ranch</h2>

<p>Ranch is also getting close to 1.0. I am currently writing a
test suite for upgrades. After that I also would like to write
a chaos_monkey test suite and add a getting started chapter to the
guide.</p>

<p>Ranch is pretty solid otherwise, it's hard to foresee new
features at this point.</p>

<h2>erlang.mk</h2>

<p>I didn't expect this project to become popular. Glad it did though.</p>

<p>Windows support is planned, but will require GNU Make 4.
Thankfully, it's available at least through cygwin. Make,
Git and Erlang will be the only required dependencies
because the rest of the external calls will be converted to
using Guile, a Scheme included since GNU Make 4. So it is
Guile that will download the needed files, magically fill
the list of modules in the .app file and so on, allowing
us to provide a truly cross-platform solution without
losing on the performance we benefit from using Make.</p>

<p>Also note that it is possible to check whether Guile
is available so we will be able to fallback to the current
code for older systems.</p>

<p>I am also thinking about adding an extra column to the package
index, indicating the preferred tag or commit number to be used.
This would allow us to skip the individual <code>dep</code> lines
entirely if the information in the package index is good enough.
And committing that file to your project would be the only thing
needed to lock the dependencies. Of course if a <code>dep</code>
line is specified this would instead override the file.</p>

<h2>Alien Shaman</h2>

<p>This is the two-parts project requested by the LeoFS team.
This is essentially a "distributed bigwig". I am hoping to
have a prototype up in a few days.</p>

<p>Alien is the part that allows writing and enabling probes
in your nodes. Probes send events which may get filtered before
being forwarded to their destination. The events may be sent
to a local process, a remote process, over UDP, TCP or SSL.
Events may also be received by a process called a relay, which
may be used to group or aggregate data before it is being sent
over the network, reducing the footprint overall.</p>

<p>Shaman is the UI for it. It will ultimately be able to display
any event as long as it's configured to do so. Events may be logs,
numeric values displayed on graphs updated in real time, lists of
items like processes and so on.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>That's it for today! There will be another status update once
Shaman is out. But for now I have to focus on it.</p>

<p>As always, please send feedback on the projects, this post,
the sponsoring idea, anything really! Thanks.</p>
