<p>An update to The Erlanger Playbook is now available!</p>

<p>The Erlanger Playbook is a book about software development using
Erlang. It currently covers all areas from the conception, design,
the writing of code, documentation and tests.</p>

<p>The book is still a work in progress. Future topics will include
refactoring, debugging and tracing, benchmarking, releases, community
management (for open source projects).</p>

<p>This update fixes a number of things and adds two chapters: IOlists
and Erlang building blocks.</p>

<p>This is a self-published book. The base price is 50â‚¬. All proceeds
will be used to allow me to work on open source full time.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping me helping you help us all!</p>
