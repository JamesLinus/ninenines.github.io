<p>I am proud to announce the pre-release of The Erlanger Playbook.</p>

<p>The Erlanger Playbook is a book about software development using
Erlang. It currently covers all areas from the conception, design,
the writing of code, documentation and tests.</p>

<p>The book is still a work in progress. Future topics will include
refactoring, debugging and tracing, benchmarking, releases, community
management (for open source projects).</p>

<p>The following sections are currently available:
<ul>
	<li>About this book; Future additions</li>
	<li><em>Workflow:</em> Think; Write; Stay productive</li>
	<li><em>Documentation:</em> On documentation; Tutorials; User guide; Manual</li>
	<li><em>Code:</em> Starting a project; Version control; Project structure; Code style; Best practices; Special processes</li>
	<li><em>Tests:</em> On testing; Success typing analysis; Manual testing; Unit testing; Functional testing</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The book is currently just shy of 100 pages. The final version
of the book is planned to be between 200 and 250 pages.
A print version of the book will be considered once the final
version gets released. The printed book is <em>not</em> included
in the price.</p>

<p>This is a self-published book. The base price is 50€. All proceeds
will be used to allow me to work on open source full time.</p>
