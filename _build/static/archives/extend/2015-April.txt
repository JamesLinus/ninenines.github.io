Message-ID: <43C48B2E-0396-43E0-B82C-E524C8274004@wanadoo.fr>

Hi there,

I would like to learn more about the cowboy_xxxx_handler for instance the cowboy_websocket_handler  :
-  is it an OTP gen_ instance ?
- how/where the websocket_handle() is called ?
- how websocket_info() relates to the Transport:send() operation and where/how this latter function is called?

I  could not find the cowboy_websocket_handler behavior in the src dir. I guess i?ve missed something.
The code is clean but difficult to decipher by a erlang padawan like me.

Why do i need to understand this ?

I would like to write a generic tcp transport layer that provides an interface like the cowboy_xxx_handler to my protocol stack.
Of course i will use ranch underneath.

Neither the examples provided with ranch nor the ftp server tutorial reveals the sophisticated architecture used to handover data/context to the handler and to get reply data from the handler.

Thank you for your help.

Samir Sow

Presumably you are looking in master. cowboy_websocket does that in 
master now. cowboy_websocket_handler is in Cowboy 1.0.

Thanks.
Still i can?t figure out how you manage the data transmission from/to handler via the websocket_handle() and websocket_info() function.

It's a simple function call.

Assuming the variable Handler contains the name of the module, it's just 
doing Handler:websocket_info(Info, Req, State) and then checks the 
return value.
