Subject: [99s-extend] Cowboy: Maps instead of records for context variables
Message-ID: <56263F49.2000206@llaisdy.com>

Dear All

Would there be any reason against using a map instead of a record for 
the context variable in a Cowboy REST resource?

Quite often I have a few resources doing very similar things in their 
callbacks, and I'd like to abstract out the similarities into a module - 
but I don't want to share a record between modules.

Maps seem to be a good fit, and I can't think of any downside 
(performance hit should be tiny).

Can anyone give me reasons to stick with records?

With thanks and best wishes

Ivan

The only reason to use records is to keep typespecs information to 
improve Dialyzer's error reporting.

Personally I have no problems going with just maps for all kinds of 
states, even if they are in the same module. This is partly because I 
rely a lot more on tests than on Dialyzer to tell me my program is wrong.

Cheers,
