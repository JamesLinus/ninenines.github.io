<PRE>Hi,

I have recently in my production system replaced mochiweb with cowboy. The server generally works fine, except for a bizarre behavior which I cannot quite explain, so I post here, hoping to get some pointers.

After replacing mochiweb with cowboy, I noticed that in chromium (other major browsers work fine) often (but not always) a request lasts a little more than a minute. Further inspection in <A HREF="chrome://net-internals">chrome://net-internals</A> showed that browser tries to send a request, times out after 60 sec, retries and then succeeds immediately. The key point is that it doesn't happen always. First couple of requests work fine, then all of a sudden one doesn't work. At the same time requests from other browsers (including chrome) on the same machine work fine.

If I revert to mochiweb, the problem disappears. Other than web server related code, everything else is the same: the rest of my code, the server setup etc... In addition, I return same responses and headers in both versions.

After many attempts and failures, I might have worked around the issue. Namely, I included &lt;&lt;&quot;connection&quot;&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;&quot;close&quot;&gt;&gt; in all responses. After this change, it seems that long requests are not occurring. In any case, I can't reproduce it anymore, whereas before the change I could have reproduce it easily.

However, I'm not sure if I have really resolved the issue, I'm also not happy with connection closes since it degrades performance. And finally, I'm not sure if I quite understand the problem. 
The only theory I have is that due to keep-alive, chromium holds the connection, while cowboy closes it (I read somewhere that hardcoded timeout is 5 seconds, right?). In this case it might happen that chromium sends a request to a non existing socket and then hangs for a minute, waiting for the response which never arrives. 
This might further be amplified by the fact that in production, between browser and cowboy, there is a proxy/load balancer, so maybe load balancer still holds the connection despite the fact that server had closed it.

This is the only theory I currently have, and I would like to hear if you guys have some other idea or any kind of helpful pointer?

Thank you very much in advance and best regards,
Sasa
