Loic, it would be great to hear a bit, what problems have you met with.

What issues with stability can be in acceptor pool?

Also I have question about updating protocol options: have you done
something with the problem that after updating protocol options existing
workers are running with old config?

Haven't had any stability issue. What we did here is ensure that when 
any process gets killed for any reason, especially reasons we can't 
foresee, Ranch continues to work as expected.

Ranch not updating protocol options for existing connections isn't a 
problem, it won't be "fixed". Ranch can't guess how connection processes 
are implemented. It's up to you to allow this if you need it. The 
upgrade updates the options for all acceptors and all future 
connections, that's it.

I mean situation that after cowboy:update_options existing acceptors are
still working with old routes.
Currently it is useless API, so I have to stop cowboy and start it back.

Existing acceptors were using the old options for the next connection 
and then switched to the new options. But that has been fixed a long 
time ago. Ranch doesn't have that issue.

Subject: [99s-extend] Cowboy, how call my database select function
Message-ID: <1816031357681016@web3d.yandex.ru>

Hello!
Prompt please, beginning to study the Erlang.
I have a library for working with ?Redis.
Plugged it into the project Cowboy with the help of Rebar.
After the launch of a Cowboy through the script in the console ERL, I see that the function (eredis_db:get_script) is  works and I get the desired result:

EDB R15B03 (erts-5.9.3.1) [source] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]
Eshell V5.9.3.1 (abort with ^G)
1> eredis_db:get_script("example", "test").

Tell me how can I use this function in a Cowboy, in hendlers.
I hope I could explain clearly.

This was not quite clear to me, but I'll do my best.

> Tell me how can I use this function in a Cowboy, in hendlers.

Well, you'd use it like any other Erlang function. If it's in a handler, 
you probably want to use init/3 or handle/2:

handle(Req, State) ->
     _EredisScript = eredis_db:get_script("example", "test"),
     {ok, Resp} = cowboy_req:reply(200, Req),
     {ok, Resp, State}.

See other examples of implementing `cowboy_http_handler' behaviour in 
the Cowboy documentation and in the examples included with the library.

Short, quick and semi-private announcement: Ranch 0.6.1 has been tagged.

It includes a few guide updates, the addition of the raw option for 
specifying platform-specific socket options, and performance 
improvements when using the {max_connections, infinity} option.

Enjoy!

Subject: [99s-extend] Cowboy feedback needed
Message-ID: <5101A653.400@ninenines.eu>

Hey,

I'm looking into perhaps starting a project related to Cowboy and could 
use some feedback from users, particularly in the realm of numbers.

If you use Cowboy and have it in production where:

  *  Latency is vital
  *  Throughput is vital
  *  Concurrent number of connections is huge
  *  Load is huge (or would be with another solution)

Then I'd like to hear from you!

Please send me average numbers, statistics, graphs or anything where I 
can see how well it performs for you! In private if you prefer. Tell me 
if I can quote you or your company about it. Please answer even if we 
briefly discussed it in the past.

(If you found that it didn't perform enough for your needs you should 
probably open a ticket, or, if you can't, send me a private email.)

Looking forward to the feedback. Thanks!

Message-ID: <5101B89A.50604@gjunka.com>

Hi,
I understand the move away from Rebar but I'd like to see the project to 
be still Rebar-compatible. Would that be a problem? Mainly I am thinking 
about dependencies. The Cowboy Makefile assumes that Ranch is in its 
deps folder. If Cowboy is a part of a bigger application, and most often 
it will be in such a role rather than a standalone application, then all 
dependencies should be kept in one place. In that case it would be the 
main project's deps folder, not Cowboy's deps folder. Can the 
compilation process be split into compiling Cowboy dependencies 
separately from Cowboy itself?

something like:

all: compile-deps compile-cowboy

Then if Cowboy is a dependency itself it may be just compiled without 
the dependency (as it will be compiled when the main project is compiled).

Hi Loic,

I'd like to send feedback very much. But right now Cowboy is just used as
demo in my company --- BesTV (www.bestv.com.cn), which is the largest IPTV
and intenetTV operator in China. Although I think Cowby is good, the
production environment is still dominated by Java and mainstream HTTP
servers. Because I'm from Ericsson, I hope to promote Erlang here but it's
not so easy. I would send the data if Cowboy would be used in production
and fully tested.

Thank you!
Barco

A comparison (summary) of cowboy 0.6.1 and misultin 0.9 final in the context of CloudI is here:
https://github.com/okeuday/CloudI/blob/master/src/tests/http_req/loadtest/results_v1_1_0/201210_summary.pdf
(the raw Tsung results are also within the same directory)

The results are just showing the latency when putting cowboy and misultin under 10kreq/s load with both 20k and 40k connections, when the requests go through CloudI messaging into all the supported programming languages (Erlang, C/C++, pure-Java, Python/C, pure-Python, and pure-Ruby.... the "pure" part is where only the target language is used to create the CloudI API, which does the Erlang binary term format CloudI request encoding/decoding).  So, the test is showing the performance of a simple HTTP GET query parameter parse/response using XML (the XML is based on historical misultin testing).

For these tests, it showed cowboy always has less latency which is significant, if the programming language internal latency is not significant.  The cpu usage of cowboy was slightly lower than misultin for high connection counts (40k instead of 20k).  The memory usage of cowboy was significantly lower than misultin.  The test results are for R15B01 and R15B02, just due to when I did the loadtesting.

I will continue to do similar loadtests in the future to make sure and evaluate performance with more recent Erlang releases, as time allows, but the Tsung configurations are within the repository for people to test their own (hardware) environments.
