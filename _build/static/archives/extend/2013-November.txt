Subject: [99s-extend] Cowboy and Ranch 0.9.0 released
Message-ID: <5284F908.9000605@ninenines.eu>

Hello shiny people,

Cowboy 0.9.0 has been released. Ranch 0.9.0 has been released too! So 
let's start with that.

Ranch 0.9.0 is just stability improvements, better error reporting and a 
couple new SSL options.

Cowboy 0.9.0 is using it of course, and also has official SPDY support 
(documented and everything!), a revamped cowboy_static (built-in 
mimetypes support, and also documented), tons of additions to the guide, 
tons of user patches and other changes you can find here:

   *  https://github.com/extend/cowboy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

Which reminds me, I want to thank all 70 awesome contributors (myself 
included) that make the Cowboy project so fun to work on! So, thank you!

When upgrading, please be aware that:

   *  A dependency has been added, cowlib
   *  Various undocumented functions have been moved to cowlib
   *  The options for cowboy_static changed a lot, so read the guide
   *  You need to set ERL_LIBS or equivalent for cowboy_static to find 
your private directory now

You can find the updated guide on http://ninenines.eu BUT do note that 
I'm migrating the site so if you do not see "Contribute to this site" in 
the bottom left next to "Contact", then you are on the old version and 
should probably head to github for your documentation needs, or use the 
files in your clone directly. I also have improvements left to make to 
the site to make navigating documentation easier, so stay tuned!

Speaking of the guide, now all the examples, but also the getting 
started chapter of the guide, are releases. I am hopeful that this will 
make more people use releases by default instead of an awful start.sh 
script.

For details on what's coming up next, see the ROADMAP. Next step (0.10) 
is finishing the request body work, fixing some timeout issues and 
adding proper multipart support for both requests and responses. This 
will be the last significant step before 1.0. I have hopes that all this 
will be ready around the time R17 is released.

So yeah, enjoy! And as always please forward any feedback, especially 
related to the user guide as this is my main focus now.

Hello,

if I call cowboy_req:chunk on the same Req from several processes that run
simultaneously, I am guaranteed that the chunks that these processes write
to the socket will not interleave with each other?

That hasn't changed.

Chances are when you upgraded, somehow, the ets table or the key was 
deleted. Table is cowboy_clock and key rfc1123 if you want to check quickly.

Hello,

For a Cowboy-based project I?m trying to use stable (dvv/stable, written by Vladimir Dronnikov). I keep running into problems. I contacted Vladimir and he stated that the current version of stable was compatible with Cowboy 0.8 and that he didn?t have the time to keep up with new cowboy releases. Is any of the list members using stable in a cowboy based project?

Kind regards,

IIRC There were major changes around 0.8.3-8.4 when parts of the api 
changed.  I haven't upgraded to 0.9 yet but I imagine there will be 
further changes there (e.g., there is a new dependency: cow_lib).

Hi,

I have an issue.

I'd like to start 2 http handler in the same application
So i did to cowboy:start_http call + different port + dispatch route sets in the supervisor init method.

When the application starts there is no error but when i look the network tables i only see the binding for the first call.
If i comment out the first call i see the second binding.

Is there any limitation ?
If yes any workaround to share ?

Thank you.

Solved.
I overlooked to have different refs for each call.

Hello,

I'll be migrating the mailing lists to a new server as of right now. 
They should be back whenever the DNS updates for you.

In the meantime, if you have a really important question, please check 
the IRC channel #ninenines on Freenode. Service should be back for 
everyone on Monday.

Thanks for your comprehension.

The migration is a success. Please check http://lists.ninenines.eu to 
know if service is back for you before sending an email. The old server 
is refusing all emails now. Thanks!

Hi;

A post on this can be found
here<http://dc0d.tumblr.com/post/68278862491/toddling-cowboy-carful-a-windows-on-your-way>(code
on
GitHub <https://github.com/dc0d/lucky_luke>).

?Are these things this way for a reason? (Because otherwise we I can not
get samples to run.)

1 - I have to add 'cowboy' to application list in myapp.app.src.
2 - I have to add '{http_port, 9000}' to 'env' in myapp.app.src (where in
the code should I add it?).
3 - I have to explicitly make sure 'cowlib' is started (ok =
application:start(cowlib) and I did not see this anywhere but whitout this,
it won't work).

Thanks;
