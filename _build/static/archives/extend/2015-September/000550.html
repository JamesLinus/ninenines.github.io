<PRE>I was fiddling with some js, and got tired of restarting the server. I was
under the
impression that using dev_mode with relx was the solution to this problem,
but
I can't seem to get it to work. I have an example here:

<A HREF="https://github.com/grahamrhay/cowboy_devmode">https://github.com/grahamrhay/cowboy_devmode</A>

If I look in _rel, the lib folder for my app is a symlink, as expected. Yet
when I change
the web page, the rendered page is unchanged. I've tried a hard reload, and
clearing
the cache.

And, in case that wasn't annoying enough, even restarting the server isn't
enough!
Nor is running make again. In fact, the only way I've found of getting it
to update,
is to turn off dev mode, and build the release.

Am I missing something really obvious? As far as I can tell from perusing
the code,
the cowboy static handler just serves the file directly from the file
system.

(P.S. I am using vagrant, but I would expect that to cause errors rather
than this, if
the symlink wasn't working.)
