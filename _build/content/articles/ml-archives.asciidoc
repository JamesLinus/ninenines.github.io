The link:/archives/extend[old mailing list archives] have been
added to the site, mainly for referencing purposes.

The mailing list has been shut down and all personal information
has been deleted.

If you need help with a project, consider either opening a ticket
on that project's issues tracker or going through the community
channels (erlang-questions, #ninenines or #erlang on Freenode).

Prefer tickets; often when people have issues it highlights an
underlying problem in the project or its documentation.

Thanks.
