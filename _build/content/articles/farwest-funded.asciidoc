It's hard to overstate my satisfaction. Thanks to everyone who
made this possible.

If you have backed this fundraiser, and haven't provided your
personal details yet, please do so quickly so that your rewards
can be sent!

I am hoping that we will be able to make good use of all that
money. The details of the expenses will be published regularly
on the https://github.com/extend/farwest/wiki/2013-Fundraiser[2013 Fundraiser wiki page],
giving you full disclosure as to how your money is used.

It will take a little time to get things started, we are in
summer after all! We will however act quickly to make the
prototype easy enough to use so that the paid UI work can
begin. This is also when user contributions will be welcome.

You can see the https://github.com/extend/farwest/wiki/Roadmap[Roadmap]
to get more information on the current plans. This document will
get updated as time goes on so check again later to see if you
can help!

Look at me: still talking when there's open source to do!

Thanks again for all your support. I really appreciate it.
