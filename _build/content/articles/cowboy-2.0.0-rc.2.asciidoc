Cowboy `2.0.0-rc.2` has been released!

This is the new recommended version of Cowboy.
Its API should not change before release. While
you probably should not use it in production yet,
many do successfully. Use at your own risk.

This new version contains fixes for the following
issues:

* HTTP/2 server push was using the wrong header
  compression context.

* HTTP/2 flow control could end up queueing data
  in the wrong order when resuming the sending of
  data.

* The `shutdown` timeout was not implemented
  and request processes could be killed too quickly.

Please test this new release candidate and provide
feedback! The best place to provide feedback is via
tickets. Do not hesitate to open a ticket or bring
an existing ticket to my attention to get it resolved
before 2.0.
