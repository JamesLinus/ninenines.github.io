Cowboy `2.0.0-rc.1` has been released!

This is the new recommended version of Cowboy.
Its API should not change before release. While
you probably should not use it in production yet,
many do successfully. Use at your own risk.

The plan is to have a new RC version every couple
weeks until the summer ends or later if there are
still blocking issues open. Only issues that can't
be fixed without making breaking changes to the
interface may block the release.

Numerous changes were made since Cowboy 1.0. The
one most people care about is probably HTTP/2, but
it's most likely not the only one worthwhile. The
full list of changes (excluding types) can be found
in the user guide chapter
https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.0/guide/migrating_from_1.0/[Migrating from Cowboy 1.0 to 2.0].

As this is not the full release just yet, please pay
extra attention to details and report anything
suspicious you find.

There are still some tests failing. Most of those are
related to standards that are not being followed perfectly
just yet. Some of those will probably not be fixed before
Cowboy 2.0 is released. They are edge cases and should not
prevent interoperability.

The manual received a lot of love. It now has one page per
function with a detailed description, arguments list, return
value, changelog and examples. It also links to the other
relevant manual pages: https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.0/manual/

Cowboy is now tested and supported with Erlang/OTP 19.0 or above
on Arch Linux, FreeBSD, OSX, Ubuntu and Windows 7. Contact me
if you can provide permanent access to another platform for the
purposes of testing.

Cowboy is now available from four locations:

* https://git.ninenines.eu/cowboy.git
* https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy.git
* https://bitbucket.org/ninenines/cowboy.git
* https://gitlab.com/ninenines/cowboy.git

They are updated at the same time so there is no real difference.
