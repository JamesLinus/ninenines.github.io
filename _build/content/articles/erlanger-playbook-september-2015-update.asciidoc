An update to The Erlanger Playbook is now available!

The Erlanger Playbook is a book about software development using
Erlang. It currently covers all areas from the conception, design,
the writing of code, documentation and tests.

The book is still a work in progress. Future topics will include
refactoring, debugging and tracing, benchmarking, releases, community
management (for open source projects).

This update fixes a number of things and adds two chapters: IOlists
and Erlang building blocks.

This is a self-published ebook. The base price is 50â‚¬. All proceeds
will be used to allow me to work on open source full time.

Thank you for helping me helping you help us all!
