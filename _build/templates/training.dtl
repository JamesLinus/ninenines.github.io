<h1 class="lined-header"><span>Thinking in Erlang</span></h1>
<p>One day Erlang training.</p>
<p>This training should get you started with Erlang and understand how to design a highly available distributed system. Because there is only one day, we focus on the essential concepts and skip over many details that are not necessary to understand those concepts.</p>
<p>After learning the basics and doing a few exercises we will start writing a simple chat client and server and improve it as we learn new things.</p>
<p>At the end of this training you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Erlang</li>
<li>Have basic knowledge of the Erlang language</li>
<li>Understand concurrency and message passing</li>
<li>Learn how to handle errors</li>
<li>Understand how to build highly available systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Price and registration</h2>
<p>This training is designed to target a large number of people. Because of this, the training is cheaper than most alternatives. Its price is variable, depending on location and sponsoring opportunities, but should not be greater than <span class="label label-success">100â‚¬</a> per student.</p>
<p>All sessions of the <em>Thinking in Erlang</em> training must be co-organized by a sponsor. The role of the sponsor is to help find students, find a room where the training will take place and handle any other logistics. In return, the sponsor gains visibility, and can even have a few of their people trained without extra fees.</p>
<p>If you would like to co-organize a session of <em>Thinking in Erlang</em>, please <a href="mailto:contact@ninenines.eu">drop us a message</a>.</p>
